        <p>
            Almost everyone I know loves Molokhia and it is a mother's secret in Egypt to feed little kids other vegetables <br>
             You see, when kids pass their first year, and some people even do it earlier, we introduce the famous rice and Molokhia combo to them. <br>
             99.9% of the kids love it, after they get used to it, Egyptian moms start their tricks. Put a pile of rice with Molokhia <br> and hide anything in 
             there—Broccoli, peas, carrots, beans.... and so on. Just make sure to cut them into small pieces and the kids will gladly <br>lick their plates. 
             Of course when they get older they will start to object, but at least they got something and you'll feel good about their dinners.
